**INST 767 - Final Project**

**Summary about the Project**
In this project, we have an all-inclusive data system which results from the integration of four major data sources, being CVX (Chevron Corporation), SHEL (Royal Dutch Shell), XOM (ExxonMobil Corporation), and BP (BP plc). Our focus is on investigating the fluctuations and trends in crude oil and natural gas prices.
The implementation of this project has been structured into four distinct stages: data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analysis.

`INGEST` 

In this ingest stage, a Python function has been implemented within Google Cloud Functions. This function is designed to retrieve daily crude oil price data from the APIs of the four companies. The data is stored in separate Google Cloud Storage buckets, one for each company.
