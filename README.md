**INST 767 - Final Project**

**Summary about the Project**
In this project, we have an all-inclusive data system which results from the integration of four major data sources, being CVX (Chevron Corporation), SHEL (Royal Dutch Shell), XOM (ExxonMobil Corporation), and BP (BP plc). Our focus is on investigating the fluctuations and trends in crude oil and natural gas prices..The implementation of this project has been structured into four distinct stages: data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analysis.
